# QuoteGuessingGame
1. Scrape all quote pages.
2. Store quotes and author bios.
3. Pick one quote at random.
4. Ask the user to guess the author.
5. After each wrong attempt, reduce chances and provide more hints:
    - 3 guesses left → birthdate and place
    - 2 guesses left → first letter of first name
    - 1 guess left → first letter of last name
6. If correct → congratulation.
   If not → reveal author after 0 guesses.
